This library permits you to to set and use a timer. The maximum time is
set to be 50 min. The preferred time can be set using a potentiometer.
The program uses a 15 seconds increment when setting time and uses the 
Sevseg library to drive the 4 digit display.

You can find the Sevseg library @ https://github.com/sparkfun/SevSeg
Make sure to install this library before using the Timer program
